# Defund The Police

There are about 18,000 state and local police agencies in the US. Police funding is the second largest category of local government spending after education. On average, the United States spends $340 per person per year for public policing, for a total of $193 billion in spending in 2017.

When it comes to finding how much each of these departments spend individually, it can be harrowing proccessing digging through obscure documents. 

The goal of this project is to provide transparency on police budgets on a local level, and provide a social media toolkit to spread messages on how to better utilize police funding for empowering communities.
